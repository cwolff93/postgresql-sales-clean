DataCamp Project to train SQL skills in data cleaning

"In this project, you will work with data from a hypothetical Super Store to challenge and enhance your SQL skills in data cleaning. This project will engage you in identifying top categories based on the highest profit margins and detecting missing values, utilizing your comprehensive knowledge of SQL concepts.

Date fields have been written to the orders table as TEXT and numeric fields like sales, profit, etc. have been written to the orders table as Double Precision. You will need to take care of these types in some of the queries. This project is an excellent opportunity to apply your SQL skills in a practical setting and gain valuable experience in data cleaning and analysis."
